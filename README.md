# despacito_bot

A bot that plays despacito via a piezo buzzer while attempting to use a servo to drum the beat. [See it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiToCECSzXc)

I don't have a 3d printer so I have to use cardboard that I find lying around, popsicle sticks, and some hot glue.

Special shout out to my dogs for dealing with me while I programmed this. No shout out to my girlfriend who said I couldn't work on it while she was around. In retrospect that was probably a good thing for our relationship.  I had to transcribe the Despacito sheet music into each note's corresponding frequency, which was definitely a good use of my limited time on this earth.
