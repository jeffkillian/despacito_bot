# despacito_bot

I don't have a 3d printer so I have to use cardboard that I find lying around, popsicle sticks, and some hot glue.
Special shout out to my dogs for dealing with me while I programmed this
In order to make this I had to transcribe the Despacito sheet music into each note's corresponding frequency, that was a good use of my limited time alive.
